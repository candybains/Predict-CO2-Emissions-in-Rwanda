Predict CO2 Emissions in Rwanda

Description
Welcome to the 2023 edition of Kaggle's Playground Series!
Thank you to everyone who participated in and contributed to Season 3 Playground Series so far!

With the same goal to give the Kaggle community a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science, we will continue launching the Tabular Tuesday in July every Tuesday 00:00 UTC, with each competition running for 3 weeks. Again, these will be fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc.

This Episode is a similar to the Kaggle/Zindi Hackathon that was held at the Kaggle@ICLR 2023: ML Solutions in Africa workshop in Rwanda, and builds on an ongoing partnership between Kaggle and Zindi to build community-driven impact across Africa. Zindi is a professional network for data scientists to learn, grow their careers, and get jobs. If you haven't done so recently, stop by Zindi and see what they're up to!



Predicting CO2 Emissions
The ability to accurately monitor carbon emissions is a critical step in the fight against climate change. Precise carbon readings allow researchers and governments to understand the sources and patterns of carbon mass output. While Europe and North America have extensive systems in place to monitor carbon emissions on the ground, there are few available in Africa.

The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning models using open-source CO2 emissions data from Sentinel-5P satellite observations to predict future carbon emissions.

These solutions may help enable governments, and other actors to estimate carbon emission levels across Africa, even in places where on-the-ground monitoring is not possible.

Acknowledgements
We acknowledge Carbon Monitor for the use of the GRACED dataset, and special thanks Darius Moruri from Zindi for his work in preparing the dataset and starter notebooks.

Evaluation
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Submissions are scored on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:

RMSE=1N∑i=1N(yi−y^i)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−⎷

where y^i
 is the predicted value and yi
 is the original value for each instance i
.
